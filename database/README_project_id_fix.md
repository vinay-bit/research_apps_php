# Project ID Generation Fix

## Issue Description
The database triggers for generating project IDs and student IDs had incorrect SUBSTRING positioning, causing wrong sequence number extraction.

**Problem**: 
- Project ID format: `PRJ2025XXXX` (PRJ + YEAR + 4-digit sequence)
- Old trigger used `SUBSTRING(project_id, 5)` which extracted `250001` instead of `0001`
- This caused incorrect sequence numbering for new projects

## Files to Execute

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
Execute the targeted fix file:
```sql
-- Run this in your MySQL/phpMyAdmin
source fix_project_id_trigger.sql;
```

### Option 2: Complete Schema Update
Use the full production schema (if you want all latest updates):
```sql
-- Run this in your MySQL/phpMyAdmin
source production_schema_2025-07-03_14-45-26.sql;
```

## Manual Execution (if needed)
If you can't use source command, copy and paste the trigger code from `fix_project_id_trigger.sql` into phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench.

## Verification
After applying the fix, test by creating a new project:
- Next project ID should be properly formatted (e.g., `PRJ20250002` if one project exists)
- Student IDs should also be properly formatted (e.g., `STU20250007` if six students exist)

## What Was Fixed
1. **Project ID trigger**: Changed `SUBSTRING(project_id, 5)` to `SUBSTRING(project_id, 8)`
2. **Student ID trigger**: Changed `SUBSTRING(student_id, 5)` to `SUBSTRING(student_id, 8)`
3. **Added safety checks**: Only generate IDs if not already provided
4. **Better error handling**: More robust trigger logic

## Impact
- ✅ Existing projects and students are unaffected
- ✅ New projects will get correct sequential IDs
- ✅ No data loss or corruption
- ✅ Backward compatible
